# SportAttractor - FPL ICT Index public assist

FPL (Fantasy Football(soccer) Premier League) is a game in which users assemble an imaginary team of real life footballers and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance 
or their perceived contribution on the field of play. The [FPL ICT Index](https://www.premierleague.com/news/65567) uses match event data to generate a single view score for each player on three key categories â€“ Influence (player's impact), Creativity (player's producing opportunities) 
and Threat (player's threat on goal). Public users can generate a category card (on either or all of the three key categories) and initiate a discussion. In addition the users insert a Status (Low, Medium, High) to state the degree of importance of that category card.
Current users as well as other users can upvote the categories cards created. Further to a user inserting a Player as a topic in each category card, one can also insert a Feature (ex. dashboard lineups online presence, add feature fouls called on VAR). 

After all, FPL Data Scientists can accumulate all these help data to improve players indices, features stats (goals, assists etc), as well as, platform's features functionalities, appearance and responsiveness. In addition, a data scientist observes how different users interpret the meaning of each category in their own way.   

## UX

- The strategy plane: 
  - Aim: Achieve a website about Football fans who participate on virtual manager games and Data Scientists to retrieve qualitative weekly sports opinion data specific.
  - Target audience: Football fans in general and Data Scientists interacting with public opinion and accumulate scientific data. 

- The scope plane: 
  - Features
    - Registration, Login and User's Profile section
    - An initial home page explanation and browse to the three categories
    - Three sections with each categories cards published, cards create, upvotes, comments published, comments create
    - A donate section
    - A graphs section demostrating categories numerical stats

- The structure plane: 
  - Info is structured on a standard way and dynamically. One could browse on the categories (buttons) via home page (apart from donate section) or navbar
  - Per category :
    - one could press a button to create a card and through the card, one could post a comment
    - A status [Low, Medium, High] filtering (single, not multiple filtering) and a search text button to find specific cards. 
    - pagination on category cards using linked list concept
  - Donate section implies a credit card form 
  - Graphs section show three Views + Upvotes charts ( status pie chart, histogram bar chart, categories row chart)

- The skeleton plane: 
  - Page info represented from left to right (or top to bottom) concept :
    - Minimal text guidance  
    - Four buttons on home page (three categories and charts)
    - Per category 
      - two buttons (add a card and comment) and pagination (prev and next btns)
      - Three status filtering buttons, a search text input with its button submit
      - An svg backwards arrow button on view category card to return to the categories cards
    - Button submit donate amount
    - Cross filtered charts
    - Profile section showing table individual user stats per category (cards created, views and upvotes receiving numbers)

- The surface plane: 
  - Colours : home page showing UK colours and each of the three categories having its distinct colour (blue, white, red). Implemented gradient
    approach on UK colours and donate header Visa symbol.
  - Semantic : header, nav, section, article, bootswatch (cards, buttons, alert), mark, footer
  - Typography : opens sans google fonts and bootstrap libraries (row, column grid, box model, text centering, flexbox) 
    Iconic and font-awesome icons to assist users to recognize sections 
  - CSS style class helpers, transitions, animations, shadow and opacity for webpage smooth presence and readable text. 

##### User Stories list

- As a developer and user:
  - Show all three categories stats on home page to have a brief overview of their popularity
  - When creating a category card on larger devices, insert a related bg colour thus the input and text area tags are quick easy to target  

- As a developer :
  - Used UK flag three colours to differentiate the three categories and show game country location (i.e. UK)
  - Used pagination and even numbers per page to not overload the user having many categories per page to scroll and structured appearance
  - As previous and next buttons have been implemented, use page input value to be inserted by the user to achieve flexibility

- As a user : 
  - Category cards posted showing the day that has been created (i.e. Today, 3 days ago etc), to enable me understand the trend and recent topics discussed. Similarly implement datetime in each view card comment section
  - Number of comments show when viewing a card, thus one can see number of public actions at a glance without scrolling 
  - Use mark tag to highlight the two to three key values on a category card overview

A mockup frame of the website, one could find it at the attached pdf file at the directory mockup_frame. model schema on page 11 inside the pdf file.


## Features


### Existing Features

- Above mentioned on the structure and skeleton plane

---

Additional plans to be implemented in the future would be :

- thread on comments (reply to)
- Database wise, categories classes could all belong in a single model class with an inner column field called category, along with the other current fields.
  In addition, namespace on top level settings urls to refer to an exact name (ex. save_curr_page (at influence app) to stay as a single name for all 
  categories apps rather than the current cre_save_curr_page (at creativity app) or thr_save_curr_page view function (at threat app))
- Profile section 
  - Extension of bullet one point in Features Left to Implement
    - possibility of an owner to edit the card before any comment applies or delete without the need to make a request to the admin
    - A sample table as an example :
    
      | Category        | Card_Name      | Comments No | Edit Btn | Delete Btn |
      | -------------   |:-------------: | -----:      | -----:   | -----:     |
      | influence       | player-1       | 0           |   Btn    |   Btn      |
      | creativity      | feature-1      |   2         |   Btn    |   Btn      |
      | threat          | player-1       |    1        |   Btn    |   Btn      |

### Features Left to Implement

- Profile section to insert detailed data per card created by the user, thus a user to know which are the name of the cards he has created per category (using a table or list).
- Pagination dropdown form filtering for users to be able to indicate number of category cards displayed per page
- In each category home page, status filter to be multiple, rather than the current single triggered (Low or Medium or High)
- Datetime on each category footer, showing far from days also the hours ago (specifically if two cards are posted Today)
- Admin's action on category cards created after a time period of a month 
  - No comments showed, status importance to be decreased (ex. from medium to low)
  - Several comments appear, status to be incremented (ex. from medium to high)

## Testing

- Django Py Testcase class to test forms, models and views. The automated Test files can be found inside the apps. Coverage package downloaded to assist. 
  - On bash command, one could press ```python3 manage.py test``` for whole test or ```python3 manage.py test <app name>``` per app specific.

- Jasmine Js Testing for the Categories home page pagination and mock ajax page saved last browsed page (page on pagination).

- The stripe payment function has been verified with a test card and transaction following appears on stripe app personal dashboard. 

- Having tested it manually, project looks user friendly and works on different browsers and screen sizes. 

----

Encountered issues:

- Cross-browser testing, not all browsers accepted some js selector/style script and switched to jquery selector/style script 
- Save last page viewed on categories page using ajax request, event triggering avoiding duplicate actions as well as any db storage value. 
- Lot of work-around with finding the appropriate sticky footer 

## Deployment

I worked on the project at AWS Cloud9 environment.

I deployed the project on [Heroku](https://fantasy-foot-track.herokuapp.com/) 

Worked on Google Chrome and Safari Version.

Setting it up :

Below assumes not setting a virtualenv environment.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/feddieminas/django_fantasy_foot_track.git

$ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Open fantasyfoottrack folder --> settings.py file
  - Amend the SECRET_KEY (line 26) and ALLOWED_HOSTS (ex. os.environ.get("C9_HOST") env variable) on line 31

  ```
  SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")
  
  ALLOWED_HOSTS = [os.environ.get("C9_HOST"), 'fantasy-foot-track.herokuapp.com']
  ```

  Create an env.py file at your workspace and insert the related secret_key and ip link. 

  ```
  import os
  
  os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "choose_a_password")
  os.environ.setdefault("C9_HOST", "IP LINK")
  ```

  One can insert to the env.py file any other environmental variables exist on settings.py.

Run the Django Migrations :

```
$ python3 manage.py makemigrations
```
```
$ python3 manage.py migrate
```

Run the app :

```
$ python3 manage.py runserver 
```
